# MEP 1: Data - EMR
This MEP explains and sets the scope of electronic health records for our
purpose.

The basic idea is that it covers the data being stored in the hospitals and/or
a central place keeping the EMR data.


These data have these main attributes:

- owner: the patient about whom the data is
- creator: the clinician/clinic having produced the data
- holder: the party holding and storing the data
- metadata: metadata explaining what the data is. For instance:
  - prescription
  - sick note
  - X-ray
  - fMRI
  - blood test results
- data: the data itself
